      The future is coming, and sooner than you think. These emerging
      technologies will change the way we live, how we look after our bodies and
      help us avert a climate disaster. Technology moves at a relentlessly fast
      pace in the modern world. It can sometimes feel like every single day
      there are new technologies and innovations that will change our futures
      forever. But in a steady stream of announcements about new massive
      futuristic technological upgrades and cool gadgets, it is easy to lose
      track of the amazing ways the world is progressing. For instance, there
      are artificial intelligence programs writing poems from scratch and making
      images from nothing more than a worded prompt. There are 3D-printed eyes,
      new holograms, lab-grown food and brain-reading robots.
