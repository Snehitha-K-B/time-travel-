      The Stone Age began about 2.6 million years ago, when researchers found
      the earliest evidence of humans using stone tools, and lasted until about
      3,300 B.C. when the Bronze Age began. It is typically broken into three
      distinct periods: the Paleolithic Period, Mesolithic Period and Neolithic
      Period. 
      <br><u>Stone Age Facts</u></br> 
      Early in the Stone Age, humans lived in small,
      nomadic groups. During much of this period, the Earth was in an Ice Age—a
      period of colder global temperatures and glacial expansion. Mastodons,
      saber-toothed cats, giant ground sloths and other megafauna roamed. Stone
      Age humans hunted large mammals, including wooly mammoths, giant bison and
      deer. They used stone tools to cut, pound, and crush making them better at
      extracting meat and other nutrients from animals and plants than their
      earlier ancestors. About 14,000 years ago, Earth entered a warming period.
      Many of the large Ice Age animals went extinct. In the Fertile Crescent, a
      boomerang-shaped region bounded on the west by the Mediterranean Sea and
      on the east by the Persian Gulf, wild wheat and barley became plentiful as
      it got warmer. Some humans started to build permanent houses in the
      region. They gave up the nomadic lifestyle of their Ice Age ancestors to
      begin farming. Human artifacts in the Americas begin showing up from
      around this time, too. Experts aren’t exactly sure who these first
      Americans were or where they came from, though there’s some evidence these
      Stone Age people may have followed a footbridge between Asia and North
      America, which became submerged as glaciers melted at the end of the last
      Ice Age.<br>
      <u>Stone Age Wars</u></br>
      While humans had the technology to create spears and other tools to use as weapons, there little evidence for Stone Age wars.
Most researchers think the population density in most areas was low enough to avoid violent conflict between groups. Stone Age wars may have started later when humans began settling and established economic currency in the form of agricultural goods.
