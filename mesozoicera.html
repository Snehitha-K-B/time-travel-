    <h1>MESOZOIC ERA</h2>
      <p id="mesozoic-era1">Mesozoic (252-66 million years ago) means 'middle life' and this is the time of the dinosaurs. This era includes the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods, names that may be familiar to you. It ended with a massive meteorite impact that caused a mass extinction, wiping out the dinosaurs and up to 80% of life on Earth. The Triassic period was the earliest of the periods within the Mesozoic, and took place 252 to 201 million years ago. The Jurassic period was next and was approximately 201 to 145 million years ago. The Cretaceous period was the last period and most recent in the Mesozoic era. The Cretaceous period was approximately 145 to 66 million years ago
